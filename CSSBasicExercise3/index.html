                <p>How to tell if it's time for a 'sleep divorce' One day soon you may have a tool to help you quickly learn and retain names and faces, according to a new study published Wednesday in the journal NPJ: Science of Learning. Researchers from
                    Northwestern University found playing a recording of people's names during a night's deepest sleep period reinforced peoples' memories and improved their ability to recall names and faces the next morning. "Our study showed that when
                    memories are reactivated during sleep, memory abilities can be improved after you wake up," said senior author Ken Paller, a professor of psychology and director of the Cognitive Neuroscience Program at Northwestern University. In
                    fact, people were found to remember an average of one and a half more names than they did before they slept. But, Paller added, it only worked when "sleep was not disturbed at the time of memory reactivation."</p>
